venv\Scripts\activate 
python run.py 
```

## CURRENT STATUS v5

## Key Files

- app/data/*.json (member/transaction data) 
 
## PRIORITY NEXT SESSION

2. Add Charts.js for BTC price graphs 
3. Improve mobile responsiveness 
4. Add speculation tool 
5. Goal progress animations

## IMPORTANT NOTES 
- base.html was empty (fixed now) 
- Multiple /minimal routes caused errors (fixed) 
- Dashboard works but needs modern CSS badly 
- Use /minimal for demo, /dashboard for development
